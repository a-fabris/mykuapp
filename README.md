# Synopsis
Repository of my Master's thesis project at the University of Copenhagen:

"Designing a direct manipulation interface to help novices learn data analysis in R".

Keywords: *HCI, direct manipulation interfaces, information visualization, R*.

#Motivation

Learning a language is hard. The idea is to leverage a direct manipulation interface to translate graphical
interactions into native R commands. The user can affect the results either by directly editing the code or using the menu objects.

Goals:

- Learning by example
- Familiarizing with R constructs
- Foster the interplay between visual results and textual commands.

Features:

- Select a default dataset 
- Profile the data
- Explore distributions and correlations
- Edit, expand and run the native R code

#Installation
Tested configuration:

-R 3.2.1
