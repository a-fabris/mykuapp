# Synopsis
Repository for my Master's thesis project at the University of Copenhagen: "Designing a direct manipulation
interface to help novices learn data analysis in R".

Keywords: HCI, direct manipulation interfaces, information visualization, R.

#Motivation

Learning a language is hard. The idea is to leverage the advantage of a direct manipulation interface to transcribe graphical
interactions into native R commands.

#Installation
The software was tested against the following configuration:

-R 3.2.1
