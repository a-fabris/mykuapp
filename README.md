# Synopsis
Repository of my Master's thesis project at the University of Copenhagen:
"Designing a direct manipulation interface to help novices learn data analysis in R".

Keywords: *HCI, direct manipulation interfaces, information visualization, R*.

#Motivation

Learning a language is hard. The idea is to leverage the advantage of a direct manipulation interface to transcribe graphical
interactions into native R commands. The user can affect the results either by directly editing the code or using the menu objects.

-Learning by example
-Familiarizing with R constructs
-Foster the interplay between visual results and textual commands.

With the prototype you can:

-select a dataset
-profile the data
-explore distributions and correlations
-edit, expand and run the native R code

#Installation
The software was tested against the following configuration:

-R 3.2.1
